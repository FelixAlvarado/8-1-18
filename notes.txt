why is memoization helpful? 

it stroes solutions to previous problems, preventing the computation of the same problem multiple times. It improves time complexity of a problem. 

what is the difference btween memoization and tabulation?

top down 
memoization makes a table as its going
sometimes more intuitive to write 
sometimes avoids computing unneeded sub problems 

tabulations: 
bottom0up
